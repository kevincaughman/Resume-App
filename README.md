YouTube Tutorial for developing iOS apps with Parse in Swift 2.0

  In this series i'll show you how to create an iOS App with Parse in Swift 2.0. We will have a working sign up and sign in views that will store user information using Parse. We will use a tab bar controller with three tabs. First being our main page with a game, second information about yourself as a developer, and third a map with your geo location and pin drop for recruiters. This App will be a resume pretty much. This was an idea I got from Apple when I was in school. Hope you like it, and don't forget to subscribe to this series!
